FIDO Device Onboard (FDO) is functionally compatible with Secure Device Onboard (SDO). We recommend users to switch to [FDO components](https://github.com/orgs/fido-device-onboard/repositories). The support for Secure Device Onboard (SDO) has been discontinued from March 31, 2023.

# Repositories

Secure Device Onboard organization provides implementation for Secure Device Onboard (SDO) protocol.

## SDO Repositories
